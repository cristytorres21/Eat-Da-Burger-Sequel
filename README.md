# Eat-Da-Burger-Sequel
A burger logger built using mySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize.

## Synopsis
An app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger has a "Devour It!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger is moved to the right side of the page (it has been devoured). The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Same as Eat-Da-Burger but homemade ORM was replaced with Sequelize
